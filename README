This is a simple file transfer program build by golang, possibly counted as file sharing
To run,
	1) Simply build Server and Client with command "go build"
	2) Start the server in Server directory with command "server" on windows or "./server" on linux
	3) Start the client in Client directory with command "client filename ServerIP" on windows or 
	"./client filename ServerIP"
	For example, "client Westeros.png localhost"
	4) Done!(Or dead maybe)

There are pictures(Server.JPG and Client.PNG) of me running it to transfer two test files
(dummyfile.dat and Westeros.png) from my machine as server to a machine of my roommate.
